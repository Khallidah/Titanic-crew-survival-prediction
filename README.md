The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

The sinking of the Titanic has been the subject of much study and analysis, and many factors have been cited as contributing to the disaster, including the ship's speed, the lack of lifeboats, and the failure of the crew to heed ice warnings. However, one factor that has not been as widely studied is the role of passenger demographics in determining who survived.

My prediction model for the Titanic dataset helps to shed light on this issue. The model uses a variety of factors to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking, including their age, sex, class, and ticket fare. The model found that passengers who were younger, female, and in first or second class were more likely to survive. The model also found that passengers who paid a higher ticket fare were more likely to survive.

These findings suggest that passenger demographics played a significant role in determining who survived the sinking of the Titanic. Younger passengers were more likely to be able to escape the sinking ship, as they were more likely to be able to fit into the lifeboats. Female passengers were also more likely to survive, as they were given priority in boarding the lifeboats. Passengers in first and second class were also more likely to survive, as they were more likely to be able to afford a lifeboat ticket.
